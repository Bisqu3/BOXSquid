'King of the hill' - Best player in generation is cloned throughout population.
A. 300 generations with 100 pop. 10 epochs per player.
100 generations 300 pop. 10 epochs.
learning_rate = 0.02
= Converged at 4.805 +- 0.001

B. learning_rate = 0.08
100 generations 100 pop. 10 epochs
= 4.841
100 more generations
= 4.809
reached convergence of A in half the generations
setting learning_rate to 0.16 to see if similar result is achieved in 100 gens

C. learning_rate = 0.16
100 gens 100 pop
=4.813

// keep batch size at 4000. it affects how gpu handles memory.
